1. Run following commands to generate RSA key pairs. ssh-keygen isnt working with jwt-RS256(not sure why)
    $ openssl genrsa -out id_rsa_jwt.pem 2048
    $ openssl rsa -in id_rsa_jwt.pem -pubout > id_rsa_jwt.pub

   Have those files inside config folder
   Need to check whether Production server`s key pairs work with JWT.  

2. Makesure to install php-jwt using composer

3. Change database credentials.

4. Setup the mysql query
5. A sample postman request needs to displayed.With actual Ipaddress of the production server in URL.
